# incognito-tracking
While the fine folks at Incognito keep working on their project, here is a google form and script to help track your own earnings. So this can be setup for free with only the smaller amount of technical skill.

I will be updating this as a get the proper files setup, so if you download this now, it won't work.

Files:
Form - while tracking remains DIY, here is a google form you can use to track your own nodes earnings. You will need to import it, then update to have the proper accounts available. It will also allow you to edit the submission date. This way if you withdraw earnings from your node on Monday but don't submit the form until Tuesday, your tracking will be accurate. This is also useful around the end of the month so March results don't get put into April. Once you've edited the form, you'll need to connect it to spreadsheet.

Code.gs - this script updates the spreadsheet automatically with DateCleaner function. You'll need to add in your forms URLs and sheetId (where the sheet falls among the tabs).
